# Welcome to my new portfolio GitHub!

### This project was created with Next.JS and TailwindCSS and took me about 10 man hours to create. I am still practicing my code and this is one of the projects I am using to reteach myself React and Javascript. I built this web app with mobile first in mind, and is optimized to work on all screen sizes. Please enjoy my new portfolio and reach out to chat.
